Uniform Resource Locator is an identifier for internet websites

Domain Name System converts URLs to IP addresses

A query string lets you pass key value pairs into a URL

GET - get data from the server

An HTTP request, requests from a client to a server and follows the HTTP protocol

An HTTP response, responds from a server to a client and follows the HTTP protocol

Headers give more information about the response or request. User-Agent, Cookie, Content-Type, Last-Modified.

The browser “resolves” the URL into an IP address using DNS, then the browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers. The server sends a response. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed, then makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives responses from the server for each.
